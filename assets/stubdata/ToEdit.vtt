WEBVTT

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:04.300
Okay.

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:06.500
Good evening,

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:07.100
everybody.

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.700
Today is our rescheduled Board of selectmen's meeting

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.500
that was supposed to be held Monday,

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:15.700
February 13th,

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:17.500
but because of the snow storm were meeting today,

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:18.900
which is Wednesday,

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.200
February 15th.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.700
So, please join me in the Pledge of Allegiance.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.700
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.600
and to the Republic for

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:35.800
which it stands one nation under God indivisible with liberty

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.400
and justice for all.

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.000
So we'll do some introductions

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.200
and so for a change I'll start at

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:45.500
the other end of the room.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.800
So we have with us tonight like Ali Russell

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.600
Hoffman like Tomko myself Denise Griffin Wendy Wolf.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.000
Tricia Warren Town manager Tom Woodin

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.300
and Kellie Bigos

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.400
So let's see.

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.200
We will move on to town manager reports

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.200
or tell manager announcement stomp.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.900
Next meeting.

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.600
I think she's going to want to do an

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.400
executive session to discuss possibly upcoming Union negotiations

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.500
and possibly other things.

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.900
I'm not sure also Gary Stone from First

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.000
Investors has asked to come to

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.400
that meeting as well to explain.

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.000
How are investments have been doing?

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.800
I think I sent out the Investments a few weeks back.

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.900
They have been doing very well,

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.900
and he wanted to explain them in layman's terms better than

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:42.600
I could so you'll be at the next meeting.

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.700
Also, I received in the mail just recently a bunch

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.200
of papers from Department of Transportation informing me

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.200
that they're going to be doing some construction in the downtown.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.700
We already knew it's basically in front of the Popcorn Shop.

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.900
They're going to be fixing some drainage down there.

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:07.000
That's why the Sewer District left the road somewhat opened still so

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.300
that when they go back in it fit

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:09.400
on a to go through payment again,

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:16.100
but in this notification they have asked for the Selectmen to sign off

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:21.600
on them bringing over weight limit trucks down on their road

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.000
which strikes me as kind of license.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.900
Is there road anyway,

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.600
but I wouldn't have any problem with signing

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.000
that off to say they could bring their trucks down.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.400
So that's going to be hopefully at the end of the meeting.

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.200
And last

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:37.600
but not least.

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.800
I just wanted to do a shout-out for Public Works

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.000
that only for Boothbay Harbor

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.600
but Boothbay as well from then to snow storm.

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:45.300
We just had

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.800
and everybody's working round the Round the Clock to dig out

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:53.200
and hopefully tomorrow this evening tomorrow will be too bad.

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.800
But just thank you to all of them for their hard work

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.700
and they do a lot to keep us safe.

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.000
Got done a great job.
