New York City is the largest city in the U.S. It also produces transcripts of city council meetings. But trying to get them is not easy.
You need to file a request and pay $1 per page or $20 for an electronic copy of each meeting.

## The Goals

There are many advantages when more people are active in the working of government.

- Issues that matter most are the ones that will get the most attention.
- Bills that only benefit a select few are less likely to be passed.
- Candidates for office can be judged on past performance rather than election promises.

If we follow ancient Athens' rule for citizen participation, we should have:

- 14% citizen attendence at council meetings. (6,000 out of 43,000)
- A town with 4,000 registered voters should have 560 attendees.
- A mid-size city of 100,000 voters should have 14,000 attendees.
- A city of 1 million voters should have 140,000 people attending.

The tools for democracy haven't changed much in 2,500 years. But with today's technolgy, we may finally be able to create the tools we need.
In today's world, attendance will need to be virtual and mostly not in "real time".

The ultimate goal is to enable as many towns and cities as possible to follow what the founders of democracy intended.
Govmeeting is designed to work anywhere and in any language.
The only requirement is that official government meetings be open to the public or transcripts be made available.

Most other "Open Government" projects rely on government supplied data. Govmeeting takes a different approach.
It uses government data if available. But if government can't or won't supply the data, it provides a way for citizens to create the data themselves.

The initial focus is on tools that work at the local level. Lessons learned there can help us build tools for the regional, state and country level.

Disillusion with democracy starts at the local level. Fixing this requires a grassroots effort at that level.

Democracy is in peril throughout the world today. If it is to survive, it needs to become an essential part of people's lives. This can only begin at the local grassroots level.
