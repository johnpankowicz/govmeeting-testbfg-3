Public Meetings are the heart and soul of democracy. They are where citizens present opposing views and come to consensus on decisions that affect us all.

In the Athenian Assembly of 500 BC, a quorum of 6,000 of the 43,000 citizens was needed to conduct business. In the 10th century, the Icelandic Althing was held in a natural outdoor amphitheater and all citizens could attend.

Today it is rare to see more than a dozen attendees at a council meeting in a town of 30,000 people. Is this still democracy?

Meetings are sometimes broadcast on TV, but few watch them. Some newspapers report on some issues. But few people know most of what transacts during these meetings.

There are many fine people who enter public office in order to improve their communities. But the current opaque system makes it too easy for others to use the office to benefit themselves.

The purpose of Govmeeting is engage more people and provide more openness into the democratic process.

## Problems with current access

It is not usually a priority for government officials to keep voters very informed about their actions. Only a few large cities make transcripts of their meetings available.
And they are often difficult to obtain and use.

Philadelphia is the 6th largest city in the U.S. It's government strives for openness. There are many intitiatives to engage citizens.
Meeting transcripts are available on its website. But quickly finding information in them is still difficult.

Click below to show a sample transcript page.
It's 154 pages of double-spaced lines, 10-words-per-line. Its PDF format is unusable on small screens, since the size can't be adjusted.
There's no table of contents. The index is possibly usable by a legal researcher, but not an average person.
